            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2012 by a group of adventure enthusiasts and former competitive rafters, Paris White Water
                Rafting began as a
                bold idea: to bring the thrill of white water rafting to the heart of France. Inspired by the energy of
                the Seine and
                the symbolism of the Eiffel Tower, the founders envisioned a company that blended adrenaline with
                elegance.
                Starting with just two rafts and a handful of guides, the company launched its first tours in the
                fast-moving alpine
                rivers of southeastern France. Word spread quickly, and by 2015, Paris White Water Rafting had expanded
                to offer
                multi-day expeditions, corporate retreats, and eco-tourism packages.
                In 2018, the company introduced its signature “Eiffel Rapids Experience,” a themed adventure that
                combined rafting with
                cultural storytelling, making it a hit with international tourists. With a commitment to safety,
                sustainability, and
                unforgettable experiences, Paris White Water Rafting has grown into one of the most recognized names in
                European
                adventure tourism.
                Today, the company operates across several rivers in France and continues to innovate with new gear,
                training programs,
                and community outreach — all while keeping the spirit of Paris alive in every splash.
